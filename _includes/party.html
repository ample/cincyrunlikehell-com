        <p>Just beside the finish line, this costume race becomes a costume party. You’ll have free food and drinks, reasonably priced craft beer and live music. It’s like being a kid again – dressed up, walking from booth to booth and picking up treats.</p>
        <p>In its 24 years, Run Like Hell has raised over $1.5 million to go towards the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. This year, while rounding up your friends and picking out your costume, we challenge you to form a team and start one hell of a fundraiser.</p>
